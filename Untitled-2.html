    <td>Hepatitis B is a viral disease that causes liver inflammation and damage. Over time, chronic hepatitis B infection can cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.</td>
    <td>DTaP vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against three different bacterial diseases:


      Pertussis ("whooping cough") is a highly contagious bacteria that causes respiratory illness lasting two or more weeks, typically with a cough that sounds like a whoop. Pertussis in infants can lead to pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death.
    </td>
    <td>Pneumococcal vaccines protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacteria that can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia (bacterial infection of the bloodstream).7
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pneumococcal polysaccharide VIS.
      
       The two types of pneumococcal vaccines are pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15 and PCV20) and the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).</td>
    <td>Polio is a rare viral infection transmitted through contaminated water or food or direct contact with an infected person. The vast majority of infections occur with no symptoms. Less than 1% of those infected will develop paralytic poliomyelitis, while between 1% and 5% will experience non-paralytic meningitis</td>
    <td>Rotavirus is a viral infection that can cause severe gastroenteritis (stomach flu) in infants and children, leading the dehydration and, in some cases, death. Rotavirus is the most common cause of childhood diarrhea worldwide. Roughly 80% of rotavirus deaths occur in the developing world.</td>
    <td>The MMR vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against three different diseases:14

      Measles is a viral disease spread by respiratory droplets or airborne transmission that causes a widespread rash and can lead to encephalopathy (brain damage).
      Mumps is a viral disease that causes the painful inflammation of the salivary glands and can also affect the pancreas, testicles, and brain.
      Rubella (German measles) is a viral disease that affects the skin, lymph nodes, and joints. It can cause birth defects in babies if an infection occurs during pregnancy</td>
    <td>Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox. The disease is highly contagious, causing itchy, fluid-filled blisters on the skin. Young children are at the greatest risk of hospitalization from chickenpox.</td>
    <td>Hepatitis A is a viral disease that causes liver inflammation. It is typically transmitted by the oral-fecal route. Though rarely fatal, hepatitis A can cause epidemics, which are a major threat to public health and safety.</td>
    <td>The influenza vaccine protects against seasonal flu. For most people, seasonal flu is nothing more than a nuisance, causing short-term illness. However, for some, flu can be severe and even life-threatening. Babies, older adults, and people with compromised immune systems are among those with a high risk of complications.</td>
    <td>Meningococcal vaccines protect against meningococcal disease, an illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitides. Infection with N. meningitides can lead to meningitis, bacteremia, and septicemia</td>
    <td>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of related viruses, some of which cause genital warts and others of which can lead to cervical cancer, anal cancer, and other types of cancer</td>
    <td>The herpes zoster vaccine protects against shingles, a painful condition caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus later in life. In addition to causing painful, blistering lesions, shingles can lead to severe complications, including chronic post-herpetic pain and even vision loss if the eye is involved.</td>
    <td>Rabies is a serious viral illness transmitted by the saliva of infected animals. It can take weeks, months, or years for symptoms to appear, but once they do, rabies almost always leads to death.30 Rabies is rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The greatest number of cases are seen in India, China, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</td>
    <td>Cholera is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the Vibrio cholera bacteria. Cholera causes watery diarrhea that can run the gamut from mild to life-threatening. The infection is transmitted through contaminated water in areas with poor sanitation</td>
    <td>Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease common in sub-Saharan Africa and South America. An infection can cause fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and the characteristic yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). Severe cases can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, acute kidney failure, encephalopathy, and cerebral edema.</td>
    <td>Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection called Salmonella typhi. Symptoms include high fever, weakness, fatigue, headache, loss of appetite, stomach pain, and occasionally a rash. The bacteria is transmitted via contaminated food and water.</td>
